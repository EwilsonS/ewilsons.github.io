        <h2>Endorsements</h2>
        <div class="endorse">
            <p class="endorse-row-a">Thank you for taking the initiative to ensure we can run... This is another example of how you see a need and step in to solve it, even if the rest of us don't seem to quite see it yet. My development work already has benefitted from your initiative.</p>
            <p class="endorse-row-b">Evan has been a patient, encouraging, and friendly presence since day one, and it's been an absolute joy to work with him so far. He's always been more than willing to stop explain the things I don't quite understand, and his flexible way of thinking makes him both receptive to the suggestions and feedback of others as well as a valuable source of insight. Without him, I don't think I would have been able to adapt to my new work environment as well as I feel I have.</p>
            <p class="endorse-row-a">Thanks for being a driving force in the success of ########! You've shown real grit in moving the product forwardeven when deadlines were tight, full-timers were few, and domain knowledge was overwhelming. Your obsession (in agood way) with learning and growing yourself and others is refreshing and just what the lab needs in our remote situation.</p>
            <p class="endorse-row-b">I love the way you respond to feedback! I learn so much about mental agility from you. Thank you!</p>
            <p class="endorse-row-a">Thank you for your constant availability and collaboration. I really appreciate the lessons and your input.</p>
            <p class="endorse-row-b">Thanks for everything you do to make the ####### team a great team to be a part of.  Whether it's frequent collaboration, always supporting your teammates through helpful feedback, or regularly bringing new ideas and being receptive to others' ideas, it all contributes to making a great team atmosphere.</p>
